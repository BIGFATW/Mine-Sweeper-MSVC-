# Windows 10 Minesweeper

Since Windows 10 ans later there's no longer minesweeper game

So I determined to create my own game by C++.

This is written in only Visual C++ 2019, executable in Windows.

You need to install VC enviroment otherwise it will miss essential libraries.

This is created in 2019 fall, so the code is very long.

(I believe nobody want to focus on my code)
